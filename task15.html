    For whatever reason, this song got in my head and has been stuck there over the past few days. The folk song part lodged itself in my head and I found myself humming it unconsciously. My extremely shaky knowledge of Malayalam notwithstanding, I realised there was a story in it and went looking for it. Of course, the first part of it was figuring out the meaning of the words, and then came the backstory. But, for dramatic effect and all that, we will look at it in reverse order â€“ the backstory first and the meaning after.
