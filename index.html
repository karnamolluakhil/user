        <p>shivaji (born February 19, 1630, or April 1627, Shivner, Poona [now Pune], India—died April 3, 1680, Raigad) was an individual who opposed the Mughal dynasty and founded the Maratha kingdom in 17th-century India. His kingdom’s security was based on religious toleration and on the functional integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus.</p>
