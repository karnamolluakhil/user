Women in a Sanjay Leela Bhansali song are often presented as strong, courageous, fearless, emotional, and a woman of content. His lady loves to dance with her fellow sakhi be it the famous Dola re Dola from Devdas, Pinga from Bajirao Mastani, and Ghoomar from Padmavat. Dholida from Gangubai Kathiawadi, where the lead character Gangubai aka Alia Bhatt is seen playing with her sahiyar’s.
The song is set in retro India. As always, the set in SLB movies becomes an essential character. Through the magical lens, the chawls, talkies, film posters, and the poster of the famous Dalda are interwoven with the setting.  A simple street with minimal light bulbs and an interesting traditional ‘Toran’ elevates the visual beauty.
